console.log(
  "Do not go gentle into that good night,\nOld age should burn and rage at close of day;\nRage, rage against the dying of the light"
);
console.log(
  "Though wise men at their end know dark is right,\nBecause their words had forked no lightning they\nDo not go gentle into that good night."
);
console.log(
  "Good men, the last wave by,\ncrying how bright\nTheir frail deeds might have\ndanced in a green bay,\nRage, rage against the dying of \nthe light."
);
console.log(
  "Wild men who caught and sang\nthe sun in flight,\nAnd learn, too late, they grieved\nt on its way,\nDo not go gentle into that good\nnight."
);
console.log(
  "Grave men, near death, who see\nwith blinding sight\nBlind eyes could blaze like \nmeteors and be gay,\nRage, rage against the dying of\nthe light."
);
console.log(
  "And you, my father, there on the \nsad height,\nCurse, bless me now with your \nfierce tears, I pray.\nDo not go gentle into that good \nnight.Rage, rage against the dying of \nthe light."
);
